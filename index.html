        <h3>Chapter 1: The Upbringing</h3>
        <p class="pcstoryleft"><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;One day at the city of <i>Naga</i>, a baby sheep was given birth by his <i>mama</i>.<br>
            <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He was brought back home and grew up in his hometown <i>Pili</i>, a known town from the region of chili.<br>
            <sup>3</sup>&nbsp;His family loved him so much they gave him the utmost care so he grew up as a good sheep beyond compare.<br>
            <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He seems like any ordinary sheep at his age, very cheerful, loving and curious but at times he is so serious.<br>
            <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;He loved to question everything from a very young age but most of his peers are not on the same page.<br>
            <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He often ask his mom anything on a whim and his mom loved that about him.<br>
            <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Little by little, He started to learn different kind of things, from reading, counting, and even sketching.<br>
            <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;All of it has helped him excel somehow at school, a few peer thinks he is cool.<br>
            <sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He made his parents very proud but shortly after, he realized it is all he can offer.<br>
            <sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Don't get it wrong, he is still a good sheep but he thinks a little deep.<br>
            <sup>11</sup>&nbsp;In his perspective, the world seems different for him so his future looks dim.

        <h3>Chapter 2: The Black Sheep</h3>
        <p class="pcstoryright"><sup>12</sup>&nbsp;It was during his adolescence that he found out his happy days won't last, it's when he realized he is a <b><i>black sheep-an outcast</i></b>.<br>
            <sup>13</sup>&nbsp;It happened that fast, he is now a homebody, isolating himself away from everbody.<br>
            <sup>14</sup>&nbsp;He found it harder and harder to be around people, his social life has been crippled.<br>
            <sup>15</sup>&nbsp;It just never felt right, interactions seems too draining and bond with friends reached their ending, he just kept on failing.<br>
            <sup>16</sup>&nbsp;It was an awful feeling so while his heart is aching, <i>anime</i> and gaming are his form of coping.<br>
            <sup>17</sup>&nbsp;His studies also started to crumble and disappointment took its toll.<br>
            <sup>18</sup>&nbsp;But despite it all, he continued to push through not knowing if he will make it through.<br>
            <sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Life is indeed a struggle, living is such a hassle but with a bit of luck he was at shock.<br>
            <sup>20</sup>&nbsp;He still managed to finish his studies through the help of some buddies.<br>
            <sup>21</sup>&nbsp;It made him happy for some time until he got lost in thought and paused, he realized his existence is for naught.

        <h3>Chapter 3: The Light</h3>
        <p class="pcstoryleft"><sup>22</sup>&nbsp;He was lost, confused, he has blown his fuse.<br>
            <sup>23</sup>&nbsp;How can someone like him compete, he has no extraordinary feats, he accepted his defeat.<br>
            <sup>24</sup>&nbsp;He felt so low and so down in sadness he is drowned.<br>
            <sup>25</sup>&nbsp;He just wanted to perish but his wish was quickly extinguished.<br>
            <sup>26</sup>&nbsp;It was halted by the light, a small ray of light had given him a fight.<br>
            <sup>27</sup>&nbsp;He was told <b><sub>"Living is a right, so stand up and fight"</sub></b>.<br>
            <sup>28</sup>&nbsp;The light is a family, a friend and a confidant, with them he is now far less reluctant.<br>
            <sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Now he thought there is hope so there's no need for the rope.<br>
            <sup>30</sup>&nbsp;He has put aside his failure, he knows he can endure because even when his wool turned black, everyone still got his back.<br>
            <sup>31</sup>&nbsp;But at the end of the day no matter what they say, it is still up to himself if he is ready to take the adversities.<br>
            <sup>32</sup>&nbsp;He then tried to set aside his insecurities in order to look for possibilities.

        <h3>Chapter 4: The New Beginning</h3>
        <p class="pcstoryright"><sup>33</sup>&nbsp;The light lifted him off his feet, it pat his back and set him on the right track.<br>
            <sup>34</sup>&nbsp;He started to change little by little, albeit still brittle he is getting ready to hustle.<br>
            <sup>35</sup>&nbsp;The sheep that was once known to have accepted defeat regained some hope and has finally coped.<br>
            <sup>36</sup>&nbsp;He is still in search of that one thing, a path to believe in.<br>
            <sup>36</sup>&nbsp;Countless hours searching, he is still unsure, <sub><b>Is there even a cure?</b></sub><br>
            <sup>37</sup>&nbsp;But the light never failed to give him comfort, an unending support.<br>
            <sup>38</sup>&nbsp;He has always thought that the world is a dark and scary place but this time he knows he always have an ally, in the light he can rely.<br>
            <sup>39</sup>&nbsp;But he still knows that not all types of light are helpful, some has no effect and some are harmful.<br>
            <sup>40</sup>&nbsp;He just made the right action, a descision to let the right light guide his vision.<br>
            <sup>41</sup>&nbsp;That made him realize that besides his search for success, he wanted to be what saved him, no less.<br>
            <sup>42</sup>&nbsp;There is nothing more meaningful than being this powerful, to put other people's lives into overhaul.<br>
            <sup>43</sup>&nbsp;Now it is his goal, to put his mission, a valiant vision into fruition.
